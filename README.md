# CSharpGradeCalc (Student Grade Average Calculator)

## 🌟 About the Project
This project is a straightforward grade calculation tool developed using a **C# Console Application**.

The application calculates a student's **overall average grade** based on **two exam scores** and **one final project score** provided by the user. It then determines and displays the corresponding **letter grade** for that average.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Secure Input Handling:** All grades received from the user undergo **input validation**. Grades must be numerical and fall within the 0 to 100 range.
* **Average Calculation:** Accurately computes the arithmetic mean of the entered grades.
* **Letter Grade Determination:** Determines the student's letter grade (e.g., `AA`, `BB`, `FF`, etc.) based on the calculated average and prints the result to the console.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* C# (Console Application)
